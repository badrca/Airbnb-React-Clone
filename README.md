# React Airbnb Clone

This is my first ever attempt at learning react. I just wanted to get to know what all the fuss and hype about react was. React proved me and I actually found it kind of cool to work. This project was done following the coding bootcamp Le wagon's intro to react on youtube. It took a hours to write and a lot of time to figure out how to get the damn search working even tho it was very easy. 

This is project is an exploration into the world of react and how it works
